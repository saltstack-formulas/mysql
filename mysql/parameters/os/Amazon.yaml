# Setup variables specific to salt['config.get']('os') == Amazon.
# You just need to add the key:values for this `os` that differ
# from `defaults.yaml` + `<osarch>.yaml` + `<os_family>.yaml`.
#
# If you do not need to provide defaults via the `os` config,
# you can remove this file or provide at least an empty dict, e.g.
# values: {}
#
# This file will be merged with `salt.slsutil.merge`:
#
# You can select the merging strategy by defining the `strategy` dict
# with one of: `aggregate`, `list`, `overwrite`, `recurse`, `smart`, e.g.
# strategy: 'recurse'
#
# If you use the `recurse` or `overwrite` strategy, you can aggregate
# the lists by defining the `merge_lists` dict with a boolean, e.g.
# merge_lists: 'true'
